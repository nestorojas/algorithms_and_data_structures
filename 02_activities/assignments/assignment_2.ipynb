    "The logic is straightforward and easy to follow, making the code maintainable and understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Potential Improvements and Adjustments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Range Calculation:```\n",
    "The current range calculation stops at largest_num, but it should ideally stop at n as described in the initial problem statement (0 to n). This can be adjusted as:\n",
    "for n in range(largest_num + 1):\n",
    "\n",
    "```Output Consistency:```\n",
    "According to the problem statement, the function should always return a list. Therefore, instead of returning -1, it should return [-1] when there are no missing numbers or the input list is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Comments and Documentation:```\n",
    "While the provided comments are good, they can be made more consistent and aligned with Python documentation standards for clarity. For example, inline comments might be placed immediately after or above the code they describe.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Default Edge Case Handling:```\n",
    "The solution currently does not handle cases where the largest number in the list is less than the length of the list. Adjustments should be done to ensure the range calculation includes all numbers up to n."

    "This exercise served as a robust simulation for coding interviews, comprising two key parts: solving a coding problem and conducting a code review.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Assignment 1, I tackled the problem of detecting duplicates in a binary tree using Breadth-First Search (BFS). Focusing on the structural definition of a binary tree, I utilized the TreeNode class, representing nodes with value and child references. Leveraging BFS for level-order traversal, I initialized a queue with the root node and used a set for tracking seen values, ensuring O(1) average complexity for lookups and insertions. The while loop managed node traversal, dequeuing nodes, checking for duplicates, and enqueuing children. This approach maintained O(n) time and space complexity, where n is the number of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Assignment 2, I critically analyzed a code solution aimed at identifying missing numbers in a sequence. Through detailed examination, I highlighted areas for improvement such as refining range calculations, ensuring consistent output, and enhancing comments for better clarity. This peer-review practice honed my ability to evaluate code efficiency, manage edge cases, and leverage best practicesâ€”skills essential for technical interviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combined, these tasks underscored the importance of selecting appropriate algorithms and the collaborative nature of software development. Both exercises reinforced vital skills in problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and effective communication, crucial for excelling in coding interviews and professional environments."
